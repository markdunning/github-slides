# Github: What, why & Welcome

----

# Learning Objectives

- Explain what is version control
- Recall why version control is crucial for researchers and *not just for programmers*
- Tell the differences between Git and Github
- Create your first GitHub project

----

# Version Control

Management of *changes*, called *revisions* to any types of information

- Simple file versioning
  + add v1.0, v1.1,...to file names
- Simple tools
  + Google Drive, Dropbox
- Advanced tools
   + subversion and git
   
----
 
 # Management of changes
 
 - Revision
  + Associated with a *timestamp* and the *person* making the change
  + Compared, restored, and with certain types of file merged
- Main Benefits
  + Go back to previous versions
  + Store history of changes
  + Collaborate with others
  
----

# GitHub is an online service

- hosts your repositories (projects)
- helps you work with contributors / collaborators
- web interface for version control

----

# Interfaces to GitHub

- directly online
- with the Github Desktop App
- via the command line using 'git'
- via RStudio for R fans

----

- *Merge*
  + act of incorporating new changes (commits) from one branch to another

  + Commit
  - Issue
  - Branch
  - Pull Request
  - Merge

# Glossary & Questions

- Don’t worry if you haven’t gotten all the terms yet
  + we’ll give you time to play more and clarify any questions. 

---

# Collaborating with GitHub

----

# Workflow #1 - Add Collaborators

- As the owner of a repo you:
  + add people as collaborators 
  + each collaborator can read/write files in the repo 
  + each collaborator is adding files and other content; making branches and either directly merging changes in or via pull requests

----

![](images/add-collab3.png)

----

# Why and When would I add collaborators?

- You’re building a website and you have a team of trusted teammates.
- You’re writing a paper and multiple people will be writing and editing.
- You’re developing a new course and multiple people are developing content.
- You are doing an analysis and need your collaborator to do a code review.
- etc...

----

# *You add collaborators when they are a core part of your team! *

----

# Workflow #2 - Fork + Pull Request

- If you don’t own a repo and aren’t an official collaborator:
  + you will fork a repo - mmm yummy
  + work on your forked copy of the repo 
  + in order to get your changes pulled into the original repo ; make a pull request for the changes you’ve made
  + the author/owner of the original repo will determine if your changes are cool; and merge them in.
  + Make friends = Big party!

# GitHub and Markdown

----

Markdown is a simple text “markup” language made for quickly writing formatted text - great for blogging, documentation, and even writing papers. If you can make an emoji, you can write markdown! 

![](images/markdown-mou.gif)

----

Markdown is important because GitHub automatically renders anything written in Markdown. This can be specific files (eg: README), or your comments on pull requests and issues.

Some useful resources:

----

# Exercise: My First Pull Request

Work in pairs to edit a file in your partner's GitHub repository using a pull request. (And vice versa.)

---

# GitHub Desktop Essentials

----

# Desktop Essentials

- Need files on your local computer (or compute cluster)
  + Edit using local tools
  + Run software on your machine
  + Synchronise among several computers via GitHub
- GitHub Desktop provides GUI
- Git provides command line (no GUI on Linux)

----

# GitHub, your repo, your working files

![](images/git-workflow.png)

----

# Install GitHub Desktop locally (Mac, Windows)

![](images/github-desktop-install.png)

----

# Branches

- When opening the repo folder on your computer, it opens it with the branch showed in GitHub Desktop

----

# Using the command line

```
> git clone repo

> git status
> git add changed_file
> git commit -m "Commit message"

# Exercise: Working Locally

![](images/exercise-working-locally.png)

---

# Moar things you can do with GitHub

----

# Lead your own open source project

These special files are really useful for new contributors:

- README
- CONTRIBUTING
- CODE OF CONDUCT
- LICENSE

----

# README

![](images/welcome.jpg)

----

# The almighty README

![](images/readme-raw.gif)

It is a file (*.md*) with text in it that describes

- what you're doing, for who, and why
- what makes your project special and exciting
- how to get started
- where to find key resources

-----

# CONTRIBUTING

in your root directory, all caps, in markdown

![](images/contributing.png)

- location
- cheer
- how-to
- style
- Link appears when you contribute to a project

----

# CODE OF CONDUCT

code of conduct (n).
> a set of rules outlining the social norms and rules and responsibilities of an individual project, party of organization

----

# Why is it needed?

![](images/code-of-conduct1.png)

----

# Why is it needed?

![](images/code-of-conduct2.png)

----

# Getting started

- Describe core words; these could be values, ideals or characteristics of people you want to be associated to your community
- Behaviours to encourage? Discourage?
- Process of bringing issues to the table
- Consequences of breaking the code
- Understanding your role

----

# LICENSE

in your root directory, all caps, in markdown

- *sharing your project* online isn't everything
- it's important to tell people *how they can use* that project
- choosing an open source license can be confusing
- Some folks created [ChooseALicense.com](http://ChooseALicense.com) to help you make that decision

----

# Don't want to license?

- You're under no obligation to choose a license
- It's your right not to include one with your code or project...
- Generally speaking, the absence of a license means that the default copyright laws apply
- This means that you retain all rights to your source code and that *nobody else may reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from your work*. This might not be what you intend

----

# Host a website


 GitHub is able to host a special website for you
 
 - [https://datachampcam.github.io/friendly-github-intro/](https://datachampcam.github.io/friendly-github-intro/)
 - https://[yourGitHubName].github.io/[YourRepo]
 
 You're hosting the webpage through your fork!
 
----
 
 # Settings
 
 ![](images/gh-pages.png)
 
 - Click *settings* tab to setup the webpage
 - The homepage will be your *README.md* file
  + it gets rendered to HTML on the fly
  + no need to write HTML code, only markdown!
